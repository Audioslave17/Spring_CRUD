This repository demonstrates basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot, showcasing the use of core RESTful annotations:

@PostMapping – Create a new resource

@GetMapping – Retrieve one or all resources

@PutMapping – Update an existing resource

@DeleteMapping – Delete a resource

@RequestBody – Map the HTTP request body to a Java object

@PathVariable – Extract values from the URI path

@RequestParam – Handle query parameters in the request

@Autowired – Inject service or repository dependencies automatically

ResponseEntity – Customize HTTP responses with status codes and body content

The project provides a simple and clear example of building REST APIs in Spring Boot using best practices and annotation-based routing. Ideal for beginners looking to understand the fundamentals of RESTful services in Spring.
